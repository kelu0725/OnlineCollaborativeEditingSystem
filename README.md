# Deployment Environment

# Install Node.js & npm
There are two options to install Node.js. You may install Node.js either by downloading it from Node.js website, or by installing a Node Version Manager (NVM) (Recommended). 

If you download and install Node.js from its website, it can cause permissions errors when you try to install a package globally (e.g.: npm install -g nodemon, npm install -g @angular/cli), because the Node.js installation process installs npm in a directory that only has local permissions. 

## Install nvm for Mac OS
1.To install or update nvm, you can use the install script (install.sh) using curl:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```
This command loads nvm: 
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```
To verify the installation, type the command below, which should output 'nvm' if the installation was successful. 
```command -v nvm```
Or, you can run nvm --version, which should return the version of nvm installed.

## Install / Reinstall Node.js with NVM
Install the latest version with: nvm install node</br>
Use the latest version with: nvm use node</br>
Install the latest LTS version with: nvm install --lts (Recommended for most users)</br>
Use the latest LTS version with: nvm use --lts (Recommended for most users)</br>

## Uninstall Node.js & npm Youâ€™ve Installed (Optional)
If you havenâ€™t had Node.js installed yet, just skip this. If youâ€™ve installed Node.js with executable file downloaded from the Node.js website, you need to uninstall Node.js and npm before reinstall them with NVM. 
I used this command below to remove node and npm-related resources.  you may follow the instructions on npm: npm - removal. 
```
sudo npm uninstall npm -g
```
Usually, the above instructions are sufficient. That will remove npm, but leave behind anything you've installed. If that doesn't work, you can try:
```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/{bin/{node,npm},lib/node_modules/npm,lib/node,share/man/*/node.*}
```
### Install nodemon ðŸ”—
npm install -g nodemon

### Install Angular CLIðŸ”—
Prerequisites: Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with npm 3 or higher.
npm install -g @angular/cli
To verify that Angular CLI has been installed, run: 
```
ng -v
```


Nodemon
sudo npm install -g nodemon</br>
ä½¿ç”¨npm å®‰è£…nodemonç»„ä»¶
Angular5n</br>
Install nvm to install angular-cli(recommended)</br>
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
