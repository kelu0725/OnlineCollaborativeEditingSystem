Asynchronous javascript programming
单线程，one thread

1.Callback

function(() => { console.log("") }, 5000);

* syntax: () parameter, =>, {}
* this is a callback syntax, after 5000, finish the task

回调函数，只有其他函数发生才发生
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function(normally asynchronous) has finished executing.
It is used to make sure certain code doesn't execute until other code has already finished execution.

-----------------------------------------------------
2. Promise

- represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation
- produce a single value in the future: resolved value or a reason why it is not resolved
- it's in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, pending

-----------------------------------------------------
let promise7 = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
  console.log('promise executed');
  setTimeout( () => {
    resolve ('If the promise is resolved, we print it with then')
    reject(new Error('Sorry, we purposedly make it an error'))
  },2000);
});

promise7.then((value) => {
   console.log(value);
})
// if promise is resolved, the resolved value is passed to the promised
//output is resolved.
-----------------------------------------------------

3. Reactive programming
- paradigm that works with event-based asynchronous data streams
- data streams: UI events, http requests, file systems, array-like objects, memory/cache
- stream:
A sequence of ongoing events ordered in time, emits values, error or complete signal
EVERYTHING IS A STREAM

-----------------------------------------------------
4.Observable
the listening to the stream is called subscribing.
the functions we are defining are observers.
the stream is the object(or "observable") being observed
Observer Design Pattern

Observable: an invokable collection of future values or events,
watch these streams and emit notification when a value, error or complete signal is returned

-----------------------------------------------------
5. Reactive Extensions/Reactive X
asynchronous programs by using observable sequences
provides a long list of operators which allow us to filter, select, transform, combine and compose observables.
rxjs

-----------------------------------------------------

6. Observables vs Promises
- observables: multiple values, synchronous or asynchronous; promise has one value only
- observables can be cancelled, let observer unsubscribe

-----------------------------------------------------
7. observable execution
Observable.create() : a lazy computation that only happens for each observer that subscribes
Observables Execution: next, error, complete

-----------------------------------------------------
8.Subscription
an object that represents a disposable resource, usually the execution of an Observable
unsubscribe(), cancel the ongoing execution

-----------------------------------------------------
9.observer
consumer, a set of callbacks, 3 types of callbacks for each type of Observable

-----------------------------------------------------
10. pull vs push
different protocols to communicate between data producer and data consumer.
Pull: Consumer determines when it receives data,
Push: Producer determines when it sends data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  single                                       |  multiple
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pull | function(computed when called)                |  iterator           | synchronous
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
push | promise(may or may not return a single value) | observable(lazy push)| asynchronous
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Subject
RXJS Subject is a special type of observable that allows values to be multicasted to many observers.
就是一个live系统，eventemitters，有很多人可以register as listeners

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. BehaviorSubject
keep last value
